# ReactJS Component Library Template
![Build](https://github.com/robertsoniv/my-components/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This is a starter template for creating a component library using ReactJS. It uses Rollup for the build, Jest for tests, and Storybook for documentation. I'm probably going to keep improving this so that it has _everything_ one would need for a complete continuous integration workflow; such as, tagging and publishing new package versions.
